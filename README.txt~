David Trethewey's Martian scripts
=================================

These are primarily based on my 2014 MSc dissertation
on Martian glaciers. Most of these scripts are highly ad-hoc in
nature and this is an attempt to provide a little more regularised
version of these primarily for my own reuse of code towards related
and other projects.
