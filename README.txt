David Trethewey's Martian scripts
=================================

These are primarily based on my 2014 MSc dissertation
on Martian glaciers. Most of these scripts are highly ad-hoc in
nature and this is an attempt to provide a little more regularised
version of these primarily for my own reuse of code towards related
and other projects.

drawCircle.py:
==========
A couple of Python functions that return a list of points
approximating the drawing of a circle with an N sided polygon

mmc1_HRSC+HiRISE_coverage_forsummarystats_cleaned.csv
=====================================================
The data file based on the Souness et al. 2012 table as supplementary
data from the paper with details of HRSC and HiRISE coverage added by hand


mmc1_HRSC+HiRISE_coverage_duplicates_possible_typos.xls
======================================================
A spreadsheet with some updated notes on the data including the
small number of duplicates and apparent errors in the Souness catalogue

SounessCatalog_converttoMarsEqCyl_lat0_40.py
===========================================
A Python script that reprojects the locations of the Souness objects
from lat/long to the 40Â° equicylindrical system. The above .csv file
is hardcoded as input and the below .csv as output

mmc1_Souness_alldata.csv
========================
The Souness objects with locations in the equicylindrical system

SounessCatalog_ROIs_shp_allMEqCyl_lat0_40.py
============================================
Creates region of interest shapefiles based on the data in
mmc1_Souness_alldata.csv
The head, terminus, left+right channel points and centre have a circle
of radius 100m defined for them, and an 'extent' is defined from these points
assuming constant channel width, and a 'context' and 'context9' defined
by expanding the extent by factors of 3 and 9 about the centre.
This also now exports the location of the
mid-line of each GLF to ''SounessGLFprofiles.csv'


NOTE - some of the zonal statistics scripts were lost...

python_zonalstats_SounessROIsMars2000Eqcyl_lat0_40_MOLA_layerstack.py
=====================================================================
Make zonal statistics based on MOLA data for the Souness glacier ROIs

python_zonalstats_RandomDataHRSCDTMtiles_Mars2000Eqcyl_lat0_40.py
=================================================================
zonal statistics based on a set of randomised ROIs - this looks like the
easiest base to rewrite back to the Souness ROIs one

python_zonalstats_MOLA_Mars2000Eqcyl_lat0_40_layerstack_combinefiles.py
=====================================================================
Collate the files together for the above zonal statistics

python_zonalstats_SounessROIsHRSCDTMtiles_Mars2000EqCyl_lat0_40.py
==================================================================
rewritten Souness ROIs zonal statistics - not tested yet!

 python_zonalstats_SounessROIs_midpoints_HRSCDTMtiles_Mars2000EqCyl_lat0_40.py
 =============================================================================
 Souness ROIs for midpoints zonal statistics

python_zonalstats_HRSC_Mars2000Eqcyl_lat0_40_layerstack_combinefiles.py
======================================================================
rewritten file to collate Souness ROIs zonal statistics - not tested yet!

rsgislib_zonalStats_DClewley.py
================================
adapted script of Dan Clewley to do the zonal stats


readGLFprofiles.py
==================
reads in the Souness GLF profiles, get elevations with GDAL
and makes PNG files of their profiles

ProfilePNGs
===========
PNG files of the output profiles

Segmentation
============

segmentation_mars_version008b_allLandSerf.py
============================================
the main one for the dissertation results

segmentation_mars_version010_rawasp_allLandSerf.py
=================================================
a different version which also does an 0.04kmsq size
for DTM resolutions better than 125m. Also uses raw aspect
rather than abs(aspect from north)

PopulateStats_HSRC_Mars2000EqCyl_lat0_40_2e5sqm_only_add9999_allLandSerfLayerstacks.py
================================================================================
Add the statistics (without +9999) to the clumps file from segmentation

PopulateStats_HSRC_Mars2000EqCyl_lat0_40_rawAsp_add9999_2e4+2e5sqm_allLandSerfLayerstacks.py
===============================================================================
same but for segmentation from rawAsp using both 2e5 and 4e4 sizes.

python_gdal_polygonize_Mars2000EqCtl_lat0_40_objectsz_2e5sqm_only_add9999_allLandSerfLayerstacks.py
===========================================================================
run gdal_polygonize for all tiles and export RAT to .csv file

python_gdal_polygonize_Mars2000EqCyl_lat0_40_rawAspectLandSerfLayerstacks_objectsz_2e5+4e4sqm.py
============================================================================
same as above but for the newer raw-aspect based 2e5 and 4e4 sqm. segmentations
